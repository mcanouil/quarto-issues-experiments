## Section

This is a simple placeholder for the manuscript's main document [@knuth84].

This contains an MWE for image embedding not working with Julia v1.11 & Quarto v1.8 and 1.9.8. 

Let's embed an image from `second-file.qmd` here:

{{< embed second-file.qmd#fig-test-figure >}}

There should've been a figure here, but it doesn't show up. This makes me very sad. 

{{< embed second-file.qmd#fig-test-figure2 >}}

Did you see the second figure which I ran `display()` on? Sadly neither did I.
